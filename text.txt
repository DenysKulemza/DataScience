Spotlight on Tuesday  night interviewed political representatives on the evening when a new British general election was agreed.  Not surprisingly, Sinn Féin chose Elisha McCallion as its representative for the programme, given that its representation of the Foyle constituency is severely under threat as per recent election results.
During the programme, Sinn Féin’s abstentionism in Westminster was contrasted to the impact that the DUP has had on politics there.  Like her aunt, Martina Anderson, Elisha tried to suggest that Sinn Féin’s influence has been central to the free state government’s, EU government’s and institutions’ directions regarding the Brexit situation.  The truth is that Sinn Féin’s influence has been negligible.  While I would never advocate taking seats in Westminster, the fact is that Sinn Féin has been totally inadequate in converting its political mandate into political influence.
Elisha McCallion on Spotlight tried to suggest that the upcoming general election was important in terms of the constitutional issue regarding a united Ireland but the truth is that Sinn Féin is not promoting a constitutional debate and, as Elisha herself indicated, Sinn Féin is keen to have the Stormont institutions back up and running.
Let’s have candidates that are solely concerned with the constitutional issue and promoting a united Ireland
